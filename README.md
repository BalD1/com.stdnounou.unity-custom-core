This is our own Unity custom core package. Please take note that even through we made it public, it is intended to our own projects, therefore might not fit yours.

It includes: 

- Our Singletons system
- A log helper
- Utility extensions methods
- A component holder, which  allows you to easily and quickly retrieve a component from an object through a dictionnary.
